This project implements a leader–follower system in ROS2 Humble using turtlesim, where the follower reproduces the exact geometric path taken by the leader with a fixed time delay. Instead of replaying velocity commands, the leader’s executed poses are recorded and used for closed-loop, pose-based path tracking. Both leader and follower commands are filtered through independent safety layers that enforce obstacle and boundary avoidance. This design prevents corner cutting, supports safety overrides, and allows tracking to resume automatically after avoidance. The overall architecture reflects realistic multi-robot system design and can be extended to real mobile robots.
